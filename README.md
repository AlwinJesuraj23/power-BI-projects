# Uber-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using Microsoft Power BI)
## Project Objective
This project involves analyzing Uber ride data to uncover key insights and trends. The dashboard visualizes metrics such as total trips, total fare, total duration, total distance, and night shift percentages, providing a comprehensive view of ride activity and performance.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/AlwinJesuraj23/power-BI-projects/blob/main/Location%20Table.csv">Dataset 1</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/AlwinJesuraj23/power-BI-projects/blob/main/Trip%20Details.xlsx">Dataset 2</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- Total Trips: Number of trips completed.
- Total Fare: Total revenue generated from trips.
- Total Duration: Cumulative trip time in hours.
- Total Distance: Total distance covered by all trips.
- Night Shift Percentage: Proportion of trips conducted during night shifts.
- Trips by Location: Distribution of trips across different locations.
- Payment Method Distribution: Percentage of trips paid using cash, Uber Pay, Google Pay, or Amazon Pay.
- Trips by Shift: Comparison between day and night shift trips.
- Trips by Pickup Time: Hourly distribution of trips.
- Trips by Day: Weekly ride patterns.

## Process
- Data Collection: Extract data from Uber's ride database or provided dataset.
- Data Cleaning: Remove inconsistencies and ensure accuracy in metrics such as fare, time, and distance.
- Dashboard Design: Utilize Power BI to design and organize visual elements like bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs.
- Filtering Options: Implement slicers to filter data by day, time, and location for focused analysis.
- KPI Calculation: Compute metrics such as total trips, fare, distance, and duration.
- Insight Generation: Interpret visual trends to derive actionable insights.
- Validation: Ensure the dashboard accurately reflects the dataset.

## Project Insight
- High-Demand Locations: Penn Station and Upper East Side are the top locations with the most trips.
- Peak Time: Most trips occur during late afternoon and early evening (peak hours).
- Payment Trends: Uber Pay dominates as the primary payment method.
- Day vs. Night: A majority of trips are conducted during the day (91.3%), with limited night shift activity (8.7%).
- Weekly Pattern: Weekdays (especially Monday to Friday) witness higher trip volumes compared to weekends.


## Final Conclusion:
The Uber Analytics dashboard highlights key operational metrics and trends essential for strategic decision-making. By understanding peak demand times, high-traffic locations, and preferred payment methods, Uber can:

- Optimize Resource Allocation: Deploy more drivers during peak hours and high-demand areas.
- Improve Customer Experience: Focus on efficient rides during peak hours and ensure better night shift coverage.
- Maximize Revenue: Target promotions in high-demand areas and incentivize preferred payment methods.
- This project demonstrates how business intelligence tools like Power BI can transform raw data into meaningful insights, empowering 
  businesses to make informed decisions.
